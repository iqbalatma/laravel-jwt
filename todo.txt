- DONE
    create redis infrastructure broken check condition
    we need to set last incident (broken cache server) date time or by default is the first time application accepting request
    first of all, we need to check is last incident date time exists
    if not, it is mean incident happen because redis is in memory db, so when server is restarted, the memory will be erased
    if not, set last incident time to now()
    then every request must be check, is iat is below incident time
    if yes, we dont know this token is on blacklist or not, so invalidate that token set to blacklist, and ask user to input their credentials again
    if not (which mean greater than last incident time) it is mean the token is issued after incident time and must be recorded on redis or cache system
